/**
 * GPGTaskHelperXPC is responsible for creating the connection to the
 * org.gpgtools.Libmacgpg.xpc XPC service, which is responsible for running
 * the gpg2 task, since the in a sandboxed environment it can't be run directly.
 *
 * GPGTaskHelperXPC is used internally by GPGTaskHelper and is only used if the
 * host app is sandboxed.
 * It keeps a weak reference to the GPGTaskHelper and returns the result of the invoked
 * XPC method to the GPGTask so that the use of XPC instead of direct launching
 * of the gpg2 task is completely transparent to the host application.
 *
 * By default status and progress messages from the gpg2 task are not handled
 * by GPGTaskHelperXPC, but an API is exposed to setup handlers for those messages.
