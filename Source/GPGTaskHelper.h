/**
 GPGTaskHelper configures and launches a GPG 2 process.
 If it's used in a sandboxed environment which doesn't allow
 to directly launch sub-processes using NSTask, it automatically
 connects to the GPGTaskHelper XPC Services which then executes
 the GPG 2 process.
 
 Pinentry pass entry is handled directly, other status messages
 from GPG 2 are forwarded to the processStatus handler.
 
 Progress can be observed by setting up the progressHandler.
